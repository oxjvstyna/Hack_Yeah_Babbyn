# 🌍 BeenThere – Social Travel Tracking App

BeenThere is a social travel app that turns your adventures into interactive stories shared on a world map.  
Simply tap on a country you’ve visited, mark it as *You've been there*, and see which of your friends have been there too.  
Each destination includes two ratings — one for **fun ❤️** and another for **security 🛡️**.  

You can upload travel photos, browse your friends’ trips, and share helpful travel tips.  
The **Friends Activity Feed** shows updates like *"John has been to Italy 5 days ago"* with photos and captions, creating a live feed of global adventures.  
BeenThere isn’t just about tracking where you’ve been — it’s about connecting with others through shared journeys.
